# Follow Me (C++)

Edit the file `src/follow_me.cpp` to write a program that keeps the robot a fixed distance away from a target directly in front of it.

See the [MBot Bridge tutorial](https://mbot.robotics.umich.edu/docs/tutorials/bridge/) for an overview of the available functions.

## Usage

To build the code, do:
```bash
cd follow_me_cpp/build
cmake ..
make
```
To run the code, do:
```bash
./follow_me
```
Press `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard to stop the code. This should stop the robot.
