# Follow Me (C++)

Edit the file `follow_me.py` to write a program that keeps the robot a fixed distance away from a target directly in front of it.

See the [MBot Bridge tutorial](https://mbot.robotics.umich.edu/docs/tutorials/bridge/) for an overview of the available functions.

## Usage

To run the code, do:
```bash
python follow_me.py
```
Press `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard to stop the code. This should stop the robot.
